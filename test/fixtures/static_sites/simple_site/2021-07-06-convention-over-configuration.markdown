# Convention over configuration.

Markdown files don't _have_ to have metadata in their frontmatter. In this case, we set the `occurred_at` date via the timestamp at the beginning of this file's name.

This file is used to assert:

- `occurred_at` can be set from filename, but still preserved in the identifier
- That the `.markdown` extension is lopped off,
