# Yet Another Static Site Generator

#convention

Arquivo can be used as a static site generator. It's meant to be quite flexible, and get you to a working little blog with a minimum of fuss.

This file is used to assert:

- Metadata is read in thru the file's yaml front matter
- That the `.md` extension is lopped off, and the url for this entry should be: `/yet-another-static-site`.
