<h1>Things should Just Work.</h1>

<p>You shouldn't <i>have to</i> write markdown in all of your entries. If you upload a plain html file, that also should Just Work, as if it were any other Entry.</p>

<p>And why shouldn't it?</p>

<p>This file is used to assert:</p>

<ul>
  <li>That plain <code>.html</code> files are loaded in as note-kind Entry, and not document kind</li>
  <li>That the contents of this file should be part of the body atribute in the Entry object.</li>
  <li>That the folder path becomes part of the identifier for an entry, and its url should be <code>/2021/should-just-work</code>.</li>
</ul>
